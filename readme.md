## Generate README.md

To generate the README.md file, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python jsontocsv.py
   ```
4. The script will convert the input JSON file to a CSV file and save it as `output.csv`.
5. The README.md file will be automatically generated with the converted data.

Make sure to replace `input.json` with the path to your JSON file if it's different.
You can also change the output file path by modifying the `output_csv_file_path` variable in the script.

**Note:** This assumes you have Python installed on your system.
